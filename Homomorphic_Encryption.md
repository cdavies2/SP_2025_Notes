# What is Homomorphic Encryption?
* Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is an innovative technology that can help you achieve zero trust by unlocking the value of data on untrusted domains without needing to decrypt it
* Sensitive encrypted data must be decrypted before it is accessed for computing and business-critical operations. This opens the door to potential compromise of privacy and confidentiality controls.
* Fully homomorphic encryption ensures that data is always encrypted and can be shared even on untrusted domains in the cloud while remaining unreadable by those doing computations.
* One can perform high-value analytics and data processing, by internal or external parties, without exposing data.
## Benefits of Homomorphic Encryption
1. Gaining valuable insights-generate measureable economic benefits by allowing lines of business and third parties to perform big data analytics on encrypted data while maintaining privacy and compliance controls
2. Collaborate confidently on hybrid cloud-process encrypted data in public and private clouds and third-party environments while maintaining confidentiality controls.
3. Enable AI, analytics, and machine learning (ML)-use AI and ML to compute upon encrypted data without exposing sensitive information.
## Use Cases
* Encrypted predictive analysis in financial services-machine learning can help us create predictive models for conditions ranging from financial transactions fraud to investment outcomes, regulations and policies often prevent organizations from sharing and mining sensitive data. FHE enables computation of encrypted data with ML models without exposing the information.
* Privacy in healthcare and life sciences-despite the efficiency of cloud in hosting workloads for large clinical trials, privacy risks and healthcare regulations can make it impractical for hospitals to transition to using the cloud. FHE can improve acceptance of data-sharing protocols, increase sample sizes in clinical research, and accelerate learning from real-world data.
* Encrypted search in retail and consumer services-technology enables large-scale monitoring of how consumers search and access information, but privacy rights make it difficult for organizations to monetize that data. FHE makes it possible to gain insights on consumer behavior while concealing using queries and protecting an individual's right to privacy.
